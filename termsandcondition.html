<h5>Changing Your Service Level</h5> <br>

<p>Some services provided by LeoSquad allow you to upgrade or downgrade your service levels. If you upgrade your service level from one package to a higher priced package, the Company will charge you thus, If you pay monthly, your first payment will be the difference between the higher priced package and your current package price, whereby monies received by Company for your current package price is prorated based on the actual number of days until your scheduled monthly payment date. Your regularly scheduled monthly payment date will remain the same as your initial purchase date, with subsequent monthly charges at the higher package price. <br>
    If you purchase or upgrade additional services that are charged on a monthly basis, your first payment for those additional services will be the price of the additional services prorated based on the actual number of days until your next monthly payment date. Your scheduled monthly payment date will remain the same as your initial purchase date, with the full price of the additional services reflected in subsequent monthly charges. If you purchase additional services that are charged on an annual basis, your first payment for those additional services will be the full price of the additional service. The renewal date for such annual additional services will be the date of upgrade to the subsequent year. <br>
    There are limited package downgrade options available and no refunds. Subscribers that wish to move from a higher priced package to a lower priced package must let the current service level expire then repurchase at the desired service level (or use the Free version if available). <br>
    Subscribers that wish to remove additional services from their account must let the current additional services expire first then repurchase any desired additional services. No refunds are available. <br>
